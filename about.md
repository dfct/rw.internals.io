# About

<img itemprop="image" class="img-rounded about_perfil" src="{{ site.profile_picture }}">

I'm Ian Bannerman, a software engineer in Knoxville, TN. 

You can reach me at ian @ this domain or on Twitter [@dfct&#95;](https://twitter.com/dfct_). I'm currently running [Verrify](https://verrify.com), a software testing startup. 

I occasionally write here at [rw &#124; io](https://rw.internals.io). I've maintained a few prior blogs but tended to set the post quality bar higher than I could afford cycles for. [rw &#124; io](https://rw.internals.io) is instead more a collection of notes I take anyway while learning, reading, & researching.
