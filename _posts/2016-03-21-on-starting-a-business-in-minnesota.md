I started a business earlier this year and collected a lot of scattered information in doing so. Here are those notes.

**How does this all work..?**

I didn’t really know what I was doing as I started the business. After all the research, events, mentor meetings, etc. the single best resource to start with was the Startup Playbook from Y Combinator - [http://playbook.samaltman.com/](http://playbook.samaltman.com/). Reading that and working through my mission, problem, product or service, business model, team, market, market growth rate, and financials was incredibly valuable. I had answers to most every question asked by a mentor or at an event, etc. as a result of this. A giant thank you to Sam Altman and everyone that contributed for publishing the playbook!

**Business Formation** 

I filed for an LLC online at [https://mblsportal.sos.state.mn.us](https://mblsportal.sos.state.mn.us). It only took a few minutes and ~$150 to file. Thompson Hall (now JUX.law) has a great series of articles on doing so ( [http://jux.law/business/formation/limited-liability-company-llc/](http://jux.law/business/formation/limited-liability-company-llc/) ).

I also filed for an Employee Identification Number online with the IRS ( [https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Apply-for-an-Employer-Identification-Number-(EIN)-Online](https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Apply-for-an-Employer-Identification-Number-(EIN)-Online) ).

I used a P.O. Box where possible as the address. As expected, I guess, I now get a ton of spam mail from people pulling the on-file addresses from the state and sending spam offers.

Still working on an Operating Agreement & business bank account, but basically every mentor I’ve spoken with has highly, highly suggested having both established early on. I looked at Venture Bank ( [http://www.venturebankonline.com/](http://www.venturebankonline.com/) ) and Silicon Valley Bank ( [http://www.svb.com/](http://www.svb.com/) ) as options focused on new businesses. Venture Bank is a local company while SVB is rather well established in the startup community and is forming a local branch office down at Industrious.

**Expenses**

I’ve been tracking expenses in a simple Numbers spreadsheet, with photos / PDFs of the relevant receipts. Tax Receipts has been a fantastic guide for what to track under which category: [http://taxreceipts.com/tax-guide/](http://taxreceipts.com/tax-guide/)

Other than gas, car insurance, and personal food & basics, most expenses have been deductible.

**Free Business Advice & Help**

There were a **lot** of resources I came across that provided free business advice. The two best ones from my experience were
* SCORE ( [http://www.score-mn.org/](http://www.score-mn.org/) )
* St. Thomas Small Business Development Center ( [https://www.stthomas.edu/centers/sbdc/](https://www.stthomas.edu/centers/sbdc/) )

The mentors from both were incredibly helpful in asking questions, exposing gaps, sharing experience, and working with me to formally develop a business plan. You can’t beat the cost of free! If your company is software oriented, you can also reach out to Minnesota Emerging Software Advisory ( [http://www.mesagroup.org/](http://www.mesagroup.org/) ). They provide mentoring advice to companies with at least a Minimum Viable Product built out, looking to grow.

One last mention, I enjoyed meeting with Meda Procurement Technical Assistance Center ( [http://meda.net/mnptac/](http://meda.net/mnptac/) ). They provide free advice and mentoring to companies looking to work with / compete for government contracts, and at least in my experience, are staffed by a few very sharp people.

**Free Legal Advice & Help**

Minnesota has a program LegalCORPS ( [http://legalcorps.org/](http://legalcorps.org/) ) that provides free business-related legal advice around the cities at various libraries and similar locations. If you’re at or under a certain income level, they can also provide full representation. The advice clinic I attended was incredibly useful, four lawyers answered every question I could think of and sent me off with a bunch of additional resources to boot.

**Potential [Venture] Funding** 

I haven’t decided whether or not to seek out funding, but while researching everything else I collected links on possible sources for future use. Here are those links:
* [http://mojominnesota.com/](http://mojominnesota.com/)
* [https://www.greatermsp.org/resources/small-business-assistance/](https://www.greatermsp.org/resources/small-business-assistance/)
* [http://mn.gov/deed/](http://mn.gov/deed/)
* [http://www.matchstickventures.com/](http://www.matchstickventures.com/)
* [http://www.comeup.capital/](http://www.comeup.capital/)
* [http://mnvest.org](http://mnvest.org)
* [http://www.eonetwork.org/eo-accelerator](http://www.eonetwork.org/eo-accelerator)
* [http://www.hillcapitalcorp.com/](http://www.hillcapitalcorp.com/)
* [http://mninnovates.org](http://mninnovates.org)
* [http://www.gopherangels.com/](http://www.gopherangels.com/)
* [http://www.entrepreneurfund.org/](http://www.entrepreneurfund.org/)
* [https://www.mhta.org/](https://www.mhta.org/)
* [http://meda.net/](http://meda.net/)
* [http://thenetworkconnect.com/](http://thenetworkconnect.com/)

Most of these also run events and programs, and are worth checking out to see if anything they have going on is relevant. There are certainly a lot of pitch events.

**Grab Bag**

A few other things I did, picked up a domain name ( [https://iwantmyname.com/](https://iwantmyname.com/) ), set up a basic webpage with Squarespace ( [https://www.squarespace.com/](https://www.squarespace.com/) ), landed at email via Office 365 ( [https://products.office.com/en-us/exchange/exchange-online](https://products.office.com/en-us/exchange/exchange-online) ), picked up business cards from Moo ( [https://www.moo.com](https://www.moo.com) ), applied & qualified for BizSpark for a whole of ton of free resources including Visual Studio from Microsoft ( [https://www.microsoft.com/bizspark](https://www.microsoft.com/bizspark) ). I looked into a coworking space before ultimately deciding not to use one. There are an ever-growing number of them in the twin cities at various price points, including COCO ( [https://explorecoco.com/](https://explorecoco.com/) ), The Reserve ( [http://reserve.work/coworking](http://reserve.work/coworking) ), Industrious ( [http://www.industriousoffice.com/locations/minneapolis](http://www.industriousoffice.com/locations/minneapolis) ), and WorkAround ( [http://workaroundtc.com/](http://workaroundtc.com/) ). Tech.MN, a great resource for all things tech in the twin cities, recently published a fantastic coworking guide as well - [http://tech.mn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ultimate-Guide-to-Coworking-in-Minnesota-2016.pdf](http://tech.mn/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ultimate-Guide-to-Coworking-in-Minnesota-2016.pdf).
