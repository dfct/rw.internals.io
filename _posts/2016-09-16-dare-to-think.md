A quote from Chapter 37 of the Chinese web novel, Way of Choices ( [ref](https://bingnovels.wordpress.com/way-of-choice/chapter-37-the-first-lesson/) ):

>Dare to think. Before your dream comes true, never limit yourself beforehand. Never find any excuses for yourself, or reasons to fail, only so will we have the possibility to make the seemingly distant dream reality.
><br/>
><br/>
>This, is my first lesson for you.

Reading translations of web novels, Chinese or otherwise, has been enjoyable beyond the stories themselves. Iâ€™ve been getting a lot out of the differences in writing styles, wisdomic sayings, and cultural values. I particularly enjoyed the lines above given my current self-employment trying to get a company off the ground.
